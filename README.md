# 🍿 Neatflix

Neatflix is a small movie database. I built it with React to play around with hooks. All movies are listed in src/movies.json.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. `yarn`
3. Create a .env.local file in the project root and set a variable named REACT_APP_API_KEY that contains your OMDB API key
4. `yarn start`
5. Enjoy a good movie! 🍿
